                <p>Kevin was born in the Virgin Islands. 
                    He was found on the streets of St. Thomas by the local humane society after Hurrican Dorian.
                    After searching for an owner it was determined he was probably a stray.
                    The Caribbean Islands have many many stray dogs and not enough people to adopt them so a lot of Humane Societies there send the animals to larger countries.
                    During COVID, many people in the United States adopted pets and shelters emptied out. 
                    The Humane Society of St Thomas sent a plane full of dogs to St Louis and that's how we ended up adopting Kevin.
                    He took a private jet from St Thomas to Puerto Rice, a ferry to Florida, and then another plane to St Louis.
                    We're very happy to have him.
